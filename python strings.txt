Q1. How can we store a single quote (‘) as a string in a variable?

In Python, we can store a single quote (') in a string variable in a few ways
1. Using double quotes

text = "It's a beautiful day"
print(text)

2.Escaping with a backslash

 text = 'It\'s a beautiful day'
print(text)

3.Using triple quotes

  text = '''It's a beautiful day'''
print(text)


Q2. Refer the below variable:
x = ‘a’
Here, is x a character type or string type variable? Support your answer with an explanation.

In Python, x in the statement x = 'a' is of string type, not a character type.

Explanation
In Python, there is no separate data type for single characters. Any text enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ") is treated as a string of type str, regardless of its length. So, even if x contains only one character ('a'), it is still considered a string.

To verify this, we can check the type of x:

python
Copy code
x = 'a'
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>
The output will show <class 'str'>, confirming that x is a string type.

Q3. Apply the following functions on this variable: ‘Welcome to Python foundation course'
SP find(0
.P count(0
?P len(0
P Concatenation
Note: You can use your choice of parameters. But make sure it is correct.


text = 'Welcome to Python foundation course'

find(): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified substring. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
index = text.find('Python')
print(index)  

count(): This method counts the occurrences of a specified substring in the string.
count = text.count('o')
print(count)  # Output: 4 (since 'o' appears four times in the string)

len(): This function returns the total number of characters in the string.
length = len(text)
print(length)  

Concatenation: You can concatenate (join) the string with another string using the + operator.
new_text = text + ' - Let’s start learning!'
print(new_text)

Q4. For the variable: word = ‘PanaJi@12256’
Calculate the following:
(a) Total number of alphabets in lowercase
(b) Total number of alphabets in uppercase
(c) Total number of numerical in string

word = 'PanaJi@12256'

lowercase_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.islower())
uppercase_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isupper())
numeral_count = sum(1 for char in word if char.isdigit())


print("Lowercase count:", lowercase_count)
print("Uppercase count:", uppercase_count)
print("Numeral count:", numeral_count)





Write a code to store a numerical value inside a variable then convert it into string.


num = 12345


num_str = str(num)


print(num_str)         # Output: '12345'
print(type(num_str))   # Output: <class 'str'>
